# Plotly (Belly Button Diversity Dashboard)
## Overview of project
> Using Javascript data visualization library the plotly.js, create an interactive data visualization for the web.
Thus, finish the partially completed dashboard by Roza, a biological researcher in a prominent microbology laboratory. 
She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer.
Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. 
That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, 
Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.



The dashboard is deployed via github pages and be accessed at https://vijaybkasturi.github.io/Bellybutton-Diversity/. The dashboard shows the demographic info for a volunteer and displays the below  charts for an interactive analysis
  - Horizontal Bar chart
  - Buble Chart
  - Gauge Chart
